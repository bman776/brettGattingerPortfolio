                    Ambitious and focused computer programmer, body builder, and historical European martial artist with a passion for continuous learning and growth. Always looking for 
                    new and exciting challenges to test myself and grow ever stronger. As a programmer, I am familiar not only with high level programming langauges like Java, Python, and C++ 
                    but I am also exeprienced with relational databases utilizing SQL and machine learning model development using powerful Python data science libraries like scikit-learn, numpy,
                    and pandas. My personal goal throughout life is to become a warrior scholar, someone with physical strength, martial skill, and intellectual curiosity. To that end then,
                    when I am not nurturing my intellectual curiosity as a programmer I am either in the gym cultivating strength as an ameuture bodybuilder or sharpening my martial skills as a 
                    German longsword fencer. It is an identity that I relish in pursuing because it means that everyday I can become stronger and more competent, allowing me to better support my friends
                    and provide for my family.
                    Having graduated from the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, my greatest career aspiration is to become a proficient data scientist and 
                    machine larning developer putting my knowledge and skills to work in the Renewable Energy Industry.
